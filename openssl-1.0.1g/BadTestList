CH : Major test case id 0x01
=================================
01)Repeat same ciphers (as given in command line) to make cid list around 4kB. 
   Not a negative case and should work.

02)Same as (1) but, fill with junk fpr all ciphers but the last one. Last one is
   the proper supplied cipher. Size 4kB.

03)Fill all ciphers with junk. (4kB)

04)Make cidlen smaller than actual value. Make cidlist as big with valid ciphers.
   Say, we put 10 ciphers.

05)Make cidlen bigger than actual value. Make cidlist as big with valid ciphers.
   Make it say, 0xFFFF

06)Test with cidlen as 0.

07)Add a smaller session id (< 32). Keep session id length properly wrt session id 
   value set.

08)Set a big session id (say 1kB) and set length properly.

09)set session id as 32 bytes, but length as max value.

10)Set a proper CH and set msglen as 0.

11)Set a msglen 1 bye more than real len.

12)Set msglen 1 byte less than real len.

13)Set msglen to biggest value 0xFFFFFF

14)Put many unknown extensions of varied length (but extn format is valid).

15)As (14), but intermix some known extensions and repeat the known extensions.

16)Put the version in CH message smaller than RH version.

17)Make a big record with many valid CH messages. Say, 64 CH messages.

18)Make proper CH and capture the sessionid. Send another record like (17) with
   the CH having that session id.

19)Keep repeating (17) and (18) and check if it causes memory outage.
